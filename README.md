# Data Generation and Simulation Tool

This tool generates synthetic data and provides predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
It includes functionalities to simulate product End-of-Life status, disassembly duration, transport mode prediction, and recycling/sorting recovery rates.

## Files Included

- `data_generation.py`: Python script to generate synthetic data and train models.
- `synthetic_data.csv`: Dataset generated by the script.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tkinter

Install the dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the data generation script:
```
python data_generation.py
```

2. The generated data will be saved as `synthetic_data.csv`.
